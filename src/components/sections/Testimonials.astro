                    TuitionBase was excellent for me, the teachers aim to really
                    push, help students go forward and provide people with good
                    teaching. Not only this, they really helped to build my
                    confidence in my work which enabled me to always do the best
                    I could in exam conditions. I came out of year 12 with AAC
                    thanks to TuitionBase for helping me believe in myself and
                    strive for the best.

                    Funniest story ever. A leaflet came through our door just at
                    the right time as my daughter was struggling with her GCSE
                    studies. After a very welcoming meeting and discussion and
                    one term later my daughter exceeded her GCSE predicted
                    grades! We were very happy!! The price was affordable, the
                    tutors were friendly and experienced. They made studying fun
                    and that's what my daughter needed.

                    Overall I am very satisfied with the service that Tuition
                    Base provides. The teachers are qualified in the subject
                    they teach and they provide lots of materials and worksheets
                    during the lesson. The average number of students in a group
                    is 4-5 which is very good as it allows the teacher to tailor
                    their teaching personally to each student.
