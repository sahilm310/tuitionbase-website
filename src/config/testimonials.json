Not only this, they really helped to build my confidence in my work which enabled me to always do the best I could in exam conditions. I came out of year 12 with AAC thanks to TuitionBase for helping me believe in myself and strive for the best.",

After a very welcoming meeting and discussion and one term later my daughter exceeded her GCSE predicted grades! We were very happy!! The price was affordable, the tutors were friendly and experienced. They made studying fun and that's what my daughter needed.",

        "text": "Overall I am very satisfied with the service that Tuition Base provides. The teachers are qualified in the subject they teach and they provide lots of materials and worksheets during the lesson. The average number of students in a group is 4-5 which is very good as it allows the teacher to tailor their teaching personally to each student.",
